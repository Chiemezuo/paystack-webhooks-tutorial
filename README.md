## About
This is a bare-bones repo for a tutorial I created on working with Paystack's Webhooks.

## Requirements
1. NPM and Node.js installed.
2. Web hosting (for the Webhook).
3. Any API client (e.g Postman, Insomnia, Hoppscotch, Swagger).
4. A Paystack account, and secret API **test** keys (not to be mistaken for **live** keys).

## Installation
I wrote an entire article that covers the setup, explanation, and configurations to make for this repo.
Do check it out [here](https://dev.to/chiemezuo/how-to-use-paystacks-webhooks-in-nodejs-2og3).
